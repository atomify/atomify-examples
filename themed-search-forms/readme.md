Themed Search Forms
===================

### Description

This is a simple example to show how apps and components can be easily customized for various use cases. The app can be built with 2 different "themes", and each version has 3 instances of a search form component with simple configuration differences.

```
git clone git@github.com:atomify/atomify-examples.git
cd atomify-examples/themed-search-forms
npm install
npm start
```

To view the alternate theme, replace `npm start` with `npm run alt`.
